#Unity3D Neural Network
This is a simple Backpropogation neural network.
<br /><br />
This project also has a demo scene showing the power of the network by using it to determine which color text is easiest to read on randomly colored backgrounds.

Users can select the color easiest to read, and after a few trials ( > 10 ) the Neural Network will show its pick for 'easiest to read color' for the given background.
